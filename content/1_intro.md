This work examines why and how Dutch finance was so heavily involved in rebuilding Spokane after the 1889 fire, as well as early boosterism and agricultural land ventures in the area. The work will be asking how a largely speculative place like Spokane in 1890 projected American identity while being so heavily shaped by foreign interest, and what regional identity was maintained after these interests were liquidated and the capital returned to Holland.

While Eastern Washington University professor John Fahey has written articles and chapters in edited volumes on the subject, I would like to explore more of the international backstory of how Dutch interest in Spokane was cultivated over time, and I am also implementing more Dutch perspectives, with around half of the reference materials made up of historic Dutch newspapers, magazines and books. To explore the aspects of identity, I am broadening the scope beyond commercial imagery to iconography more generally, implementing costume catalogs, parades, fairs and architecture.

I am in the process of writing this work now, where it will ultimately be a public history oriented digital exhibit. I will also be working on the digital infrastructure of the digital exhibit itself, although the concept is pretty straightforward compared to some of the digital humanities projects I've worked on in the past. At the moment, I'm thinking of a "scrollytelling" essay format where the text and high resolution images can interact and intersperse mapping elements to highlight the international context of the story. 

Regarding methodologies, this is a visual resources oriented history project consisting of 100 images that have been digitized from archives across Spokane. Structurally, I've tried to add a lot of the more rigorous context for the project at the front and the penultimate chapter, with the cultural iconographic pieces in the middle, hopefully allowing the reader to be oriented by that point and allow some subjective navigation of the material, rather than speculate on what visual resource material "means" explicitly. 

Amongst any other feedback that comes to mind, I am interested in possibly expanding on this digital exhibit as published work in the future. If there are any elements that seem like they would work well as a proof of concept in digital form for interested parties (or other elements that you might omit), I would be interested in how I can maybe truncate this public facing work to expand on at a later date. 

The publishing of this digital exhibit is tentatively planned for January 1st.
