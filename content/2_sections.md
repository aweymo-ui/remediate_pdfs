## The Fire, Introduction and Thesis

<br>

I'd like to begin with a passage from a Dutch newspaper named Algemeen Handelsblad, or the General Trade Journal, on January 31st 1931. The title of the article is "SPOKANE, THE PLAYGROUND OF THE NATION." followed by the tag line "Originally a trading post. — Dutch bankers helped make the city great. — The great fire. — Wheat, apples, metals, and "white coal" in reference to the hydropower of Spokane falls that was so central to early Dutch interests. The passage reads:

<br>

> "Pronounce the name: Spokhin, not Spo-keen, as you learned in school. Where is Spokane located? Ask your banker. No, don't, listen to what two jokers, black comedians, said ten-tens of years ago in one of our café chantants: 'Where is Spokane located' asks Rastus to Sam. The answer was: 'Somewhere in Holland'. Loud applause, everyone understood the joke. Because enterprising banks from the Netherlands were godparents at the birth of the new town in the Northwest of America."

On August 4th 1899 a fire destroyed 32 blocks of downtown Spokane. Self mythologizing around the fire soon became part of the narrative around Spokane, comparing the event to the Chicago fire as an example of the city founder's "indomitable energy", thanking the "rich men who came forward, and by their actions and liberal use of money inspired the confidence to make a city." 

Not included in this narrative is the fact that nearly all of this money in the rebuilding of Spokane was lent from the North Western and Pacific Mortgage Company based in Amsterdam. This led to 25% of Spokane and the majority of downtown being owned by Dutch interest by 1896. The company wrote that this fact needed to be discrete, as they feared the situation would be interpreted as a colonial interest by "western radicals."

Was the business of the Hypotheek bank in Spokane a colonial interest? According to the 1922 book, _Handbook for Knowledge of the Netherlands and its Colonies_, it was, where seized property from defaulted Spokane mortgages are listed alongside capital from Guiana and Dutch Ceylon, now Sri Lanka.

## The Cape Era Diamond Boom

<br> 

While there are always many threads involved in international economics, the most visible that connects Dutch interests to Spokane is the "Cape Era" diamond boom in the Kimberley mines of South Africa. While the land had been a Dutch colonial interest since 1652, it wasn't until the discovery of diamonds in 1867 and the formation of the De Beers Mining company that the conditions for the diamond boom were created. The company introduced new methods for mining that the Dutch had been implementing in Brazil and, crucially, collaborated with distributors to restrict supply and maintain artificially inflated prices. 

When the first shipments of diamonds from "the run" arrived in the Netherlands to be split, cut and polished by artisans in 1870, the demand caused an entirely new class structure to emerge. The South African mines generated three times as many diamonds over the twenty years of the boom as it had in the last century and a half in its Brazilian mines and this need for Dutch cleavers, cutters and polishers was reflected in their wages. Salary saw 100 to 200% increases in 1872, making more than 20 times the income of factory workers. People used their connections to join the diamond industry where it was possible and the money began to spread out into the Dutch economy more generally as these "privateers" invested in real estate, furniture, clothing, gambling and bonds.

In South Africa, De Beers prioritized control in their operations of the mines, creating a segregated "compound", where a daily average of 1,700 White men and 7,800 Black men would live inside for a series of months while they worked in the mines to curb diamond theft and prevent workers from drinking, according to De Beers. Labor was segregated, with managers, supervisors and technician roles being filled by White workers while all of the underground mine work was done by Black laborers. While not technically forced or slave labor, workers could not leave the compound until the end of their terms, and, when demand for diamond minors surged in 1878 a "hut tax" was created by the Dutch Boers to force locals into wage labor, subsequently sending almost 12,000 Africans to Kimberly to recover from the artificial debt.

As the largest client of the diamond industry on the global market, the United States drove the "Cape Era" boom. Similar to the nouveau-riche classes that emerged in the Netherlands, American interest in diamonds surged with a new class of Americans made rich by the railroad and steel industries that wanted a mobile, esthetic representation of their new wealth and class status. This reciprocal exchange of capital continued with the first American railroad loans being introduced in Amsterdam in 1873.

## Dutch Investment in American Railroad Bonds

<br>

From F.A. Hoefer's 1934 _Historical Atlas of the Netherlands_:

> "With Dutch capital and Dutch "brains," the wholly (100%) American cities of Norfolk, Virginia, Spokane , Washington, and Port Arthur, Texas were built. A more or less Dutch-owned railway connects Port Arthur with Kansas City... Numerous "granddaughter colonies" grew here.

<br>

"Kleindochter-kolonies” or "granddaughter colonies" as well as "industriecolonies" or industrial colonies are both terms used in this article for Dutch investments in America and many of these were interconnected to the emerging American railway system. There were ties between the Dutch diamond industry and the stock exchange market, and scholars have noted that investing in American railroad bonds was a form of "high-risk, high reward" gambling. 

These bonds were framed specifically towards the newly rich in the diamond industry as a way to give the "little man a high interest rate on his savings, and also give him the opportunity to one day belong to the wealthy class." While traditional voices in the financial market voiced skepticism and asked for more formal syndicates to be established to review these foreign bonds, they were intensely popular, with Dutch capital being only second to Britain in the financing of the American railroad. According to author Mira Wilkins, between 1855 to 1875 the number of American securities in the Amsterdam stock exchange rose from 7 to 78 and of those 78, 63 were railroad interests.

<br>

Another, "more or less Dutch-owned railway" that was expanding at this time was the Great Northern Railway, owned by James J. Hill and based in St. Paul Minnesota. While Hill was from Ontario, the formation of this railroad empire has its origins in Dutch bonds invested in the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad. After the 1873 financial collapse, the railway went bankrupt and was pushed into receivership by Dutch investors who owned a majority of the company's stock. James J. Hill eventually formed a syndicate with the Dutch investor's representative in New York and would create an immigration center for the Dutch in his corporation, which would create settlements across the US that happened to follow the railroad line, which eventually expanded to Spokane in 1892.

## The Hypotheek Bank

<br>

> Furthermore, I would like to point out that an American mortgage bank is preferable to a European company that issues mortgages in the United States, because... with a European one, difficulties may arise in the future... for example, a proposal was submitted to the last Congress to prohibit foreign mortgage companies..."

This recommendation was written by Herman Van Valkenburg one year before the incorporation of the Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheek bank in 1887, in a detailed survey of the natural resources, agricultural opportunities and state of transportation in the Palouse area. Van Valkenburg is written about in future Dutch newspaper accounts as lending irrationally large amounts of money, on terms that were nearly impossible to pay back. An article following the fire in 1891 noted that "The figures regarding the progress of the city of Spokane Falls in the state of Washington... are so very American, i.e., colossal... We make this remark not out of distrust in the current management... but solely as evidence of the difficulty of assessing such matters" due to the frequency of lending and building in the years after the fire.

In 1895, following an Annual General Meeting of shareholders, Van Valkenburg was granted a leave of absence after being deemed "mentally abnormal", and forced into an early retirement back in Holland. He was replaced by Thomas G Thomson, who imposed "harsh" policies, foreclosing on debtor's real estate and seizing an expanding portfolio of agricultural land, sometimes just before harvest for surplus returns. The most criticism that Thomson received from the Rotterdam shareholders, however, was when he cooperated with local religious figures to drive institutions related to prostitution out of the downtown area, giving up lucrative rent payments from their operators.

## Settlements vs. Colonies

<br>

At this point in the work, I would like to introduce Abraham Rutgers Van der Loeff. Born in Groninger, Netherlands in 1873 and educated at the Commercial Institute in Amsterdam, Van der Leoff traveled to America and eventually opened his own commercial art studio in Spokane. After a mountain of transcription, the majority of the books take place from 1893 to 1905, when he is a young adult and ending with his journey to the US, before he even arrives in Spokane. After a strange gap, the collection ends with a single book from 1915, when he is living a comfortable life of a fraternity man, seeing and being seen at various clubs, with a steady stream of fraternity commissions that he returned with fairly mid-talent output. 

That said, there is something still of interest in all of Van der Loeff's _lack_ of exceptionalism. There are revealing dynamics to how "model immigrant" classes were allowed to navigate Spokane's commercial spheres as well as the immigrant social network illuminated in his journey across America, meeting with Dutch points of contact at every step to the West coast. This section will unpack some semantic differences in Dutch settlements in America, which were fairly common for foreign nations to develop at the time, and the concept of a colonial interest. Van der Loeff's young adulthood diaries are very frequently purple prose short stories and plays that display an obsession with exoticizing and often villainizing African, Middle Eastern and South Asian characters in ways we can see reflected in his work with racialized cartoons in America lain the future.

## Costumes and Identity, Colonial, Dutch, Asian and Indigenous Iconography, Classical Allusions and Class Mimicry

<br>

This leads us to the more visual resources oriented sections, combined here for brevity. We begin by examining minstrelsy in both Dutch and Spokane and how those images are reflected in commercial objects and even real estate ventures. 

<br>

<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>

<br>

The work goes on to look into the role of ritualized costume in both fraternal and social life in Spokane, exploring a fascinating catalog from the Miller-Dervant Company, who supplied costumes for all types of events in the early 1900s.  

<br>

<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>

<br>

This is followed by an examination of South Asian iconography, in particular, studying the Northwest Museum's collection of flour sack art design for Chinese, Japanese and Filipino markets (arranged by Dutch financiers who owned the principle mills in Spokane) and exploring ways this was another form of commercial/cultural masquerade. 

<br>

<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>

<br>

This leads to the overwhelming implementation of indigenous iconography in Spokane marketing and architecture, most prominently in the Spokane Ad Club's creation of the annual Pow Wow celebration which bore the longstanding Miss Spokane contest. 

<br>

<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>

<br>

Pivoting from the romanticization of an imagined distant past that was, of course, a surviving culture, I would like to look at the ways Spokane used classical Greek and Roman iconography to assert a narrative of permanence and legacy in what was an incredibly young, still largely speculative city.

## The Arcadia Project

<br>

This section will outline what appears to be the exit strategy for Dutch finances in Spokane. Sitting on large amounts of un-irrigated agricultural land, Dutch financiers develop a multi-tiered plan to irrigate the land and develop a nationally marketed Apple Show to sell acreage to hobbyists living in Pacific Northwest cities. Once this land is sold, the remaining properties are liquidated, the irrigation system falls into disrepair. WWI largely scattered all Dutch investment in the area, with one to two traveling representatives checking in on the last accounts and the physical office finally closing in 1970.

## Liquidation, Wealth Extraction and Regional Authenticity

<br>

This section will explore how the terms of the mortgages, the ability to overbuild with Dutch finance and the Arcadia project had long term economic impacts on Spokane for the next 100 years, as well as more general thoughts on how colonial distance is necessarily extractive and unsustainable. Returning to the thesis, the work concludes with how these evocations of regional identity in the Inland Empire reflected anxieties around class, race and belonging, ending on a concept of Spokane being en example of tiered settler colonialism, where the monied classes may have had no grasp that there was a higher social strata above them, operating nearly 5,000 miles away.
